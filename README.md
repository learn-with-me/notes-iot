# Internet of Things \(IoT\)

As Wikipedia says, IoT is the network of devices that contain electronics, software, actuators and connectivity, which allows these things to connect, interact and exchange data.

IoT has evolved due to convergence of multiple technologies, real-time analytics, machine learning, commodity sensors, and embedded systems. Traditional fields of embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, control systems, automation \(including home and building automation\), and others all contribute to enabling the Internet of things.

### Applications

##### Consumer Applications

* Smart Home
* Elder Care

##### Commercial Applications

* Medical and Healthcare
* Transportation
* Building and Home automation

##### Industrial Applications

* Manufacturing
* Agriculture

##### Infrastructure Applications

* Metropolitan scale deployments
* Energy management
* Environment monitoring
* Living lab

### Enabling technologies of IoT

There are many technologies that enable the IoT. Crucial to the field is the network used to communicate between devices of an IoT installation, a role that several wireless or wired technologies may fulfill

##### Addressability

Integration with the Internet implies that devices will use an IP address as a distinct identifier. Due to the limited address space of IPv4 \(which allows for 4.3 billion different addresses\), objects in the IoT will have to use the next generation of the Internet protocol \(IPv6\) to scale to the extremely large address space required. The global adoption of IPv6 in the coming years will be critical for the successful development of the IoT in the future.

##### Short-range wireless

* Bluetooth mesh networking
* Light-Fidelity \(Li-Fi\)
* Near-field communication \(NFC\)
* QR codes and barcodes
* Radio-frequency identification \(RFID\)
* Transport Layer Security
* Wi-Fi
* ZigBee

##### Medium-range wireless

* LTE-Advanced

##### Long-range wireless

* Low-power wide-area networking \(LPWAN\)
* Very small aperture terminal \(VSAT\)

##### Wired

* Ethernet
* Power line communication \(PLC\)
