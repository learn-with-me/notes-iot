# Motors

#### Servo Motor

These are part of a closed loop system, and are comprised of several parts, namely, a control circuit, servo motor, shaft, amplifier and either an encoder or resolver.

High efficiency and great precision motors. You can control velocity, angle, position. Servo motor uses a regular motor and couples it with a sensor for positional feedback. The motor is controlled with an electronic signal, either analog or digital.

###### Classification of Servo motors

* AC or DC
  * AC - speed is determined by the frequency of the applied voltage and the number of magnetic poles. These stand higher currents and are used in industrial applications. Generally brushless.
  * DC - speed is directly proportional to supplied voltage on a constant load
* Brushed or Brushless
  * Brushed - less expensive and simpler to operate
  * Brushless - more reliable, higher efficiency and less noisy
* Synchronous or Asynchronous \(induction motor\)
  * This is discussed when it comes to AC motors
